        <h1 class="baller">15.Resident Evil 5</h1>
         <p>Before the zombie craze of today, there was Resident Evil.One of the first zombie franchises of the modern era. Entries like this one proved 
             how far and relevant the series can still be especially now that zombie fever is at an all time high.

        <h1 class="baller">14.Final Fantasy 13</h1>
        <p>The best Final Fantasy ever made. Don't let the naysayers say any different. The one that has it all, beautiful women, incredible story
            and tight gameplay form a cohesive experience. It is one of the main reasons Final Fantasy is a mainstay onto today. I mean who wants to
            put up with exploration, countless talking, and story depth anyway, let's just get to the combat which 
            this game has a plenty.

        <h1 class="baller">13.Tomb Raider Legend</h1>
        <p>Tomb Raider at it's best. Nothing can top this one, not even Nathan Drake himself.Lara doesn't 
            need expensive set pieces to drive her game. All we need and ask from Tomb Raider should be 
            exploration, puzzle solving and her huge knockers.</p>

            <h1 class="baller">12.Dirge of Cirbures: Final Fantasy 7</h1>
            <p>Being better than the legendary Final Fantasy 7 is no easy task. But screw standing around 
                taking turns kicking ass,and reading bland pretentious horribly translated dialogue,I'd take 
                running and gunning, and hearing full blown voice acting and pretty cutscenes any day. Short, sweet
                and to the point, the way every game should be.

                <p>Best hack and slasher of all time. Gore, naked women and more naked women,
                    shall I say more? Gore, gore,gore,gore,gore, nudity, nudity,nudity,nudity, shall
                    I say more?
