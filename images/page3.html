        <h1>5.Resident Evil </h1>
         <p>The one that REALLY started the zombie craze.Probably the best Resident Evil in terms of
             well everything. Impossible to change camera angles? You got it. Slow ass enemies? You got it
             Near impssoble to solver puzzles?Check. Stiff movements? Check Lack of story Check again. 
             Even after I fell asleep twice playing this game, I knew there was a masterpiece in there somewhere.
             Even when i went on to play Grand Theft Auto 5 I knew it was a masterpiece.

        <h1>4.The Grinch who Stole Christmas</h1>
        <p>I absolutely adore this game. Best Ps1 game ever. Along with Superman 64, simply best game ever.
            The Grinch? Christmas? Even better? And some really long cutscenes. Can't be beat. BUY IT.

        <h1>3.Duke Nukem Forever</h1>
        <p>Dukem Nukem. This game bleeds cool. Everything about Duke is cool. We need men to 
            be more like this and less like those chump feminist sjws that are being produced
            in society now. What happened to the good old days? Men were tough, had balls, women
            knew their place. I love Dukem Nukem.</p>

            <h1>2.E.T The Extra Terrestial</h1>
            <p> Man all the good old times I had with this legendary game. E.T. oh man I was the 
                biggest E.T fan, I laughed when he almost died in the movie and laughed even 
                more when i played the game over and over again. This is the only game I have 
                beaten more than 20 times in my life. It holds a special place in my heart.

                <h1>1.Superman 64</h1>
                <p> Superman is the lamest hero of all time.But his game is one for the ages.
                There is so much fun to be had flying through hoops over and over again. It really
                teaches you to work for your abilites, but most modern game head sjws won't get it.
                Underrated and underappreciated Superman 64 still shines more than ever.
